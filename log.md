# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Web Speech by adding speech (w/ language select) to fork of [@eszabo555](https://github.com/eszabo555/100-days-of-code)'s first 100 days of code: [Chuck Quotes](https://codepen.io/eszabo555/full/ePOZMN/).

**Thoughts:**:  Although project test suite is from freecodecamps front end framework curriculum, would be nice to rip out all the jQuery, and refactor using raw JavaScript.
